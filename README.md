This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of 129,880 airline passengers, focusing on customer satisfaction, travel behavior, demographics, and service quality. Through interactive visualizations, it uncovers patterns that help airlines enhance the passenger experience and optimize operations.

The report highlights a balanced gender distribution among travelers, with nearly equal numbers of male and female passengers. The majority of customers (81.69%) are returning travelers, showing strong loyalty, while first-time passengers make up just 18.31%. Business Class and Economy Class dominate the market, while Economy Plus represents an untapped growth opportunity at 7.25%.

Monthly trends show peaks in March, May, and October, with the lowest passenger count in February, suggesting seasonal fluctuations. The largest age segment is between 41–50 years, followed by 31–40 and 21–30 years.

Customer satisfaction analysis reveals that most passengers rated their experience as Average (67%), with 32% being Promoters and only 8% Detractors. Service ratings show strong performance in On-board Service, Cleanliness, Check-in, and In-flight Entertainment (4.0–4.1 stars), while Ease of Online Booking, In-flight WiFi, and Departure/Arrival convenience received the lowest scores (3.7–3.8 stars).

The insights suggest that improving online booking processes, WiFi quality, and travel convenience could significantly increase the “Satisfied” passenger base. Additionally, targeted marketing during low-demand months and strategies to promote Economy Plus could drive revenue growth.

This dashboard demonstrates how data-driven insights can guide customer-focused strategies, helping airlines improve loyalty, increase satisfaction, and refine their service offerings.
